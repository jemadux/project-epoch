## Installing WoW Addons on Linux

To install World of Warcraft (WoW) addons on Linux:

1. **Locate your WoW AddOns directory:**  
    This is usually found at:  
    `<your_wine_prefix>/drive_c/<projectepoch>/Interface/AddOns/`  
    Replace `<your_wine_prefix>` `projectepoch` with the path to your Wine prefix (see the Wine Prefixes section below).

2. **Download the addon:**  
    - Download the addon ZIP file from a trusted source (such as CurseForge or GitHub).
    - Extract the contents of the ZIP file into the `AddOns` directory above.

3. **Enable the addon in-game:**  
    - Start WoW via your Wine environment.
    - At the character selection screen, click the "AddOns" button and make sure your new addon is enabled.

### Using My Addons

If you want to use the addons I maintain:

- Visit the [Interface directory of my GitHub repository](https://github.com/jemadux/project-epoch/tree/main/Interface).
- Download the desired addon(s) from there.
- Extract them into your WoW `AddOns` directory as described above.

**Note:**  
Always ensure you are copying addon folders (not just files) directly into the `AddOns` directory.

> Make sure to specify the correct Wine prefix and wow folder  for your setup (see the Wine Prefixes section below) when configuring or installing addons.
